    <p>Hi! My name is Davis Land.</p>

<p>I'm a student at Texas A&amp;M University, studying Telecommunications and Media Studies.</p>

<p>I like to make stuff.</p>

<p>I was formerly an intern at <a href="http://www.atlantic.org">Atlantic Public Media</a> in Woods Hole, MA. I've also worked on a bunch of other projects with different levels and sizes of organizations. Currently I serve as the Editor-In-Chief for two publications: <a href="http://theeckleburgproject.com">The Eckleburg Project</a>, which is A&amp;M's student-run literary journal, and <a href="http://alienmouth.com">Alien Mouth</a>, an independent journal and press I started with a friend.<br /><br /> I work for the <a href="http://writingcenter.tamu.edu">Texas A&amp;M University Writing Center</a> where I produce a podcast called (http://writerightpodcast.github.io)Write Right]. I've also served as the Programming Director for <a href="http://kanm.org">KANM Student Radio</a> for a good while now, while djing and volunteering at <a href="http://keos.org">KEOS Community Radio</a>. I also produce a podcast for <a href="http://writeaboutnowpoetry.com">Write About Now Poetry</a>, which is in its third season of production.</p>

<p>I've gained a lot of different skills through making stuff; here's an incomplete list: audio and video editing, web design and computer programming, how to do writing good, emailing (it's a skill, trust me), being funny sometimes, Twitter (that's also a skill I think), book binding, the entire Adobe Creative Cloud suite, cooking, having a critical eye, driving in Boston, paying off a credit card, being a leader, the Do Not Disturb feature on my phone, tying shoes, high fiving, being a direct communicator, and a few more things.</p>

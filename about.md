Hello. My name is Josh McCormack.

I am a student at Texas A&amp;M University, studying English and Journalism. 

I have a long history in publication. During this time I have obtained experience in leadership as an editor or officer for multiple organizations, reading, editing, teamwork, communication, and ambition. during my time in these fields I have learned how to balance my studies, work, organizations and personal time. I have skills with creative software including the Adobe Creative Suite and working with submission logs both in excel and with the FasTrack manuscript software.

Currently, I am the Life and Arts Editor for Texas A&amp;M&#39;s daily newspaper [The Battalion](http://www.thebatt.com) and the Prose Editor of Texas A&amp;M&#39;s literary journal [The Eckleburg Project](http://www.theeckleburgproject.com).

I have experience as an editorial intern at a regional publishing house, [Bright Sky Press](http://brightskypress.com) and assistant to the editor at the academic peer-reviewed journal [CALLALOO](http://callaloo.tamu.edu).

Over the years I&#39;ve worked for various publications and acquired a wealth of skills. I have been the publication editor for Lone Star Community College's literary journal [SWIRL](http://www.lonestar.edu/swirl.htm) and The Woodlands High School's literary magazine [The Fife](http://twhs.conroeisd.net/Teachers/betgerlach/thefife). I also was the news and opinion editors for The Woodlands High School's newspaper, [The Caledonian](http://www.woodlandsonline.com/cdps/cditem.cfm?nid=3451)

Through these experiences, I have crafted a love for publication. I hope to pursue this passion as both a career and vocation. To me, the meaning of publication is to give people a voice, whether it is the journalist voicing a story that needs to be heard or a writer who could change someone's life with their words. 

I personally enjoy creative writing and one of my dreams is to be a published novelist. 

I am originally from Naples, Florida. I have also lived in New Jersey and Texas. Growing up in different parts of the country gave me the opportunity to experience what new places have to offer, forming a love for different regions and the people who live there. 

Tare books that communicate meaning, music that can move its listeners, movies that depict the human experience, my family whom I hold close to my heart, and my friends who I share life with.

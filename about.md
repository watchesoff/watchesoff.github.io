Hi! My name is Davis Land.

I&#39;m a student at Texas A&amp;M University, studying Telecommunications and Media Studies.

I like to make stuff.

I was formerly an intern at [Atlantic Public Media](http://www.atlantic.org)/[Transom.org](http://transom.org) in Woods Hole, MA. I&#39;ve also worked on a bunch of other projects with different levels and sizes of organizations. Currently I serve as the Editor-In-Chief for two publications: [The Eckleburg Project](http://theeckleburgproject.com), which is A&amp;M&#39;s student-run literary journal, and [Alien Mouth](http://alienmouth.com), an independent journal and press I started with a friend.<br><br> I work for the [Texas A&amp;M University Writing Center](http://writingcenter.tamu.edu) where I produce a podcast called [Write Right](http://writerightpodcast.github.io). I&#39;ve also served as the Programming Director for [KANM Student Radio](http://kanm.org) for a good while now, while djing and volunteering at [KEOS Community Radio](http://keos.org). I also produce a podcast for [Write About Now Poetry](http://writeaboutnowpoetry.com), which is in its third season of production.

I&#39;ve gained a lot of different skills through making stuff; here&#39;s an incomplete list: audio and video editing, web design and computer programming, how to do writing good, emailing (it&#39;s a skill, trust me), being funny sometimes, Twitter (that&#39;s also a skill I think), book binding, the entire Adobe Creative Cloud suite, cooking, having a critical eye, driving in Boston, paying off a credit card, being a leader, the Do Not Disturb feature on my phone, tying shoes, high fiving, being a direct communicator, and a few more things.

Hello. My name is Josh McCormack.

I am a student at Texas A&amp;M University, studying English and Journalism. 

Currently, I am the Life and Arts Editor for Texas A&amp;M&#39;s daily newspaper [The Battalion](http://www.thebatt.com) and the Prose Editor of Texas A&amp;M&#39;s literary journal [The Eckleburg Project](http://www.theeckleburgproject.com).

Over the years I&#39;ve worked for various publications and acquired a variety of skills. I have experience as an editorial intern at a regional publishing house, [Bright Sky Press](http://brightskypress.com). As an assistant to the editor at the academic peer-reviewed journal [CALLALOO](http://callaloo.tamu.edu). I have been the publication editor for Lone Star Community College's literary journal [SWIRL](http://www.lonestar.edu/swirl.htm) and The Woodlands High School's literary magazine [The Fife](http://twhs.conroeisd.net/Teachers/betgerlach/thefife). I also was the news and opinion editors for The Woodlands High School's newspaper, [The Caledonian](http://www.woodlandsonline.com/cdps/cditem.cfm?nid=3451).

Through these experiences, I have crafted a love for publication. I hope to pursue this passion as both a career and vocation. To me, the meaning of publication is to give people a voice, whether it is the journalist voicing a story that needs to be heard or a writer who could change someone's life with their words.  

I am originally from Naples, Florida. I have also lived in New Jersey and Texas. Growing up in different parts of the country gave me the opportunity to experience what new places have to offer, forming a love for different regions and the people who live there. 

I enjoy writing creativly in hopes of one day being published myself, books that communicate meaning, music that can move its listeners, movies that depict the human experience, as well as my family and my friends who I share life with.

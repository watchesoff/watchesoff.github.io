Hello. My name is Josh McCormack.

I am a student at Texas A&amp;M University, studying English and Journalism. 

I have experience as editorial interns at a regional publishing house, [Bright Sky Press](http://brightskypress.com), a daily newspaper, and the academic peer reviewed journal [CALLALOO](http://callaloo.tamu.edu).

Over the years I&#39;ve worked for various publications and acquired a wealth of skills. I have been the publication editor for Lone Star Community College's literary journal [SWIRL](http://www.lonestar.edu/swirl.htm). I currently am the Prose Editor of Texas A&amp;M&#39;s literary journal [The Eckleburg Project](http://www.theeckleburgproject.com). I am the Life and Arts Editor for Texas A&amp;M&#39;s daily newspaper [The Battalion](http://www.thebatt.com). During this time I have obtained experience in leadership, being an editor and officer for multiple organizations, editing, both creative and professional, extensively using creative software, including Adobe Creative Suite, working with submission logs, both in excel and with the FasTrack manuscript software, working with a team, communication within an organization and with outside sources like interviewees and clients, and ambition, during my time in these fields I have learned how to create balance between my studies, work, and organizations. 

Through these experiences, I have crafted a love for publication. I hope to pursue this passion as both a career and vocation. To me, the meaning of publication is to give people a voice. Whether it is the journalist voicing a story that needs to be heard or a writer who could change someone's life with their words. 

I personally enjoy creative writing and one of my dreams is be a published novelist. 

I am originally from Naples, Florida. I have also lived in New Jersey and Texas. Growing up in different parts of the country has given me an insight to how people, hundreds of miles away from one another, can so vastly different and yet so similar. 

The things that I love in this world are books that communicate to me deep meaning, music that connects with me on a spiritual level, movies that resonate with me in all forms, my family whom I hold close to my heart, and my friends who I share life with.

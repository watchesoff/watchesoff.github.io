“I’m here because I am against white supremacy,” computer science junior and student president of A&amp;M Hillel Aaron Blasband said. “I am against neo-nazism as a Jew.

Being so young, I can hardly remember playing hockey, but what I do remember is learning how to skate. My Dad, a fantastic skater and hockey player, was eager for his son to follow in his footsteps. He began to teach me how to push and glide on the ice. Hoping to gain the approval of my hero, who skated as easily as walking, I trained long and hard.

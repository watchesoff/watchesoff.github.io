“I’m here because I am against white supremacy,” computer science junior and student president of A&amp;M Hillel Aaron Blasband said. “I am against neo-nazism as a Jew.

He began to teach me how to push and glide on the ice. Hoping to gain the approval of my hero, who skated as easily as walking, I trained long and hard. After weeks of practice I could finally skate, earning the satisfaction of having my Dad be proud of me. Learning to ice skate taught me that with hard work and patience come success and satisfaction.
